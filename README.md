For this project I used the help of bootstrap to build a basic outline for my personal website. The website is designed to be functional and appeasing to the eye. It will be used mainly to display the progression of my skills within web development. 

I used bootstrap to functionally layout this site through the use of their grid system. With bootstrap the site should also look equally as nice throughout different screen sizes due to their responsive viewport tags.
